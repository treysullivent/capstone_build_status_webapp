You can log into the database with the following information:
	database: pci_database
	username: root
	password: root
	
The following command will log you in with the credentials file we have stored:
	
	mysql --defaults-extra-file=~/database/credentials/root.cnf pci_database

Alternatively, you can enter the following command and type the password, 'root'.

	mysql -h localhost -u root -p pci_database

All mySQL commands must be ended with a semi-colon (;).
